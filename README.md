- 🚀 Current Project: Artificial Intellignece for Systems Engineering
  I'm currently working on a project called "AI for Systems Engineering". In this project, we're using GenAI to assess documents according to the Automotive SPICE (ASPICE) standard and guideline.
  Here's a brief overview of the project:
      - **Document Assessment**: We're using GenAI techniques to analyze various documents. The assessment is based on the ASPICE standards and guidelines, which are widely used in the automotive industry for process improvement.
      - **Rating Generation**: Based on the assessment, we generate a rating for each document. This helps us quantify the quality of the documents and provides a clear metric for improvement.
      - **Tools & Technologies**: We're leveraging a variety of advanced GenAI tools & technologies in this project, including:
        - **Large Language Models**: These are used to understand and generate human-like text based on the input data (Proprietary & Open Source).
        - **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: This is a method that combines the benefits of retrieval-based and generative models for language understanding tasks.
        - **Prompt Engineering**: This involves crafting effective prompts to guide the LLM model's response.
        - **Embedding Creation**: We're creating embeddings from the documents, which are then used for various tasks such as document similarity, clustering, and information retrieval.
