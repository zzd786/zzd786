- 👋 Hi, I’m @zzd786
- 👀 I’m interested in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about GenAi, LLM's, RAG & Prompt Engineering. For example, use of LLMs for Natural Language understanding.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building industry soultions by utilizing GenAi.

- 🚀 Current Project: AI for Systems Engineering
  I'm currently working on a project called "AI for Systems Engineering". In this project, we're using AI to assess documents according to the Automotive SPICE (ASPICE) standards and         guidelines.
  Here's a brief overview of the project:
      - **Document Assessment**: We're using AI techniques to assess various documents. The assessment is based on the ASPICE standards and guidelines, which are widely used in the automotive            industry for process improvement.
      - **Rating Generation**: Based on the assessment, we generate a rating for each document. This helps us quantify the quality of the documents and provides a clear metric for improvement.
      - **Technologies Used**: We're leveraging a variety of advanced AI technologies in this project, including:
        - **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: These are used to understand and generate human-like text based on the input data.
        - **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: This is a method that combines the benefits of retrieval-based and generative models for language understanding tasks.
        - **Prompt Engineering**: This involves crafting effective prompts to guide the AI model's responses.
        - **Embedding Creation**: We're creating embeddings from the documents, which are then used for various tasks such as document similarity, clustering, and information retrieval.
